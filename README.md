Code repository for the manuscript: Systematic Bayesian Posterior Analysis Facilitates Hypothesis Formation and Guides Investigation of Pancreatic Beta Cell Signaling.

The original data folder containts all code necessary to reproduce results generated with original time course data.
The extended data folder contains all code necessary to reproduce results generated with extended time course data.
Both folders are structured similarly; to begin, go to the generateinputs folder to generate simulated data necessary for all posterior analyses expanded upon in the manuscript.
